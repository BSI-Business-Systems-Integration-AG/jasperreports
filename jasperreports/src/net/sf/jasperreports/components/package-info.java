* In addition to the standard report elements, such as text fields, images, charts, subreports 
* and crosstabs JasperReports has an 
* increasing number of core components that can be used to add content to generated

* others are used to embed highly specialized visualization packages, such as barcodes and 
* other types of graphics, or to generate report interactivity, like the Header Toolbar component.
